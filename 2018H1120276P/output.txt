Packet description:
    type : describes the type of packet i.e segment`O or ack packet
    length : length of data
    isLastPacket : whether it is terminal packet or not
    payload : actual data
   `O sequence No : to ensure that packets are in order

File read:
    Reading whole file in one go

File write:
    writting one pa`Ocket at a time in file

Features : 
    - random time delay in sending ack at receiver side using delay function
    - receiver `Obuffer stores whole file then write it to output.txt in one go
    - sender sends ws packets at a time and maintains base (next `Oexpected ack)
    - asynchronous calls used for timeout timer using alarm system call

To run:
Use any Unix system. Open two ter`Ominal tabs.

In the first tab, compile both the sender and receiver code with commands:
make makefile sender
make makefile recei`Over

In the first tab, start the reciever:
Usage:  %s <UDP SERVER PORT> <CHUNK SIZE>
./receiver 9999 256 .1  (set the lose rate `Oto what you want it)

In the second tab, run the Sender:
Usage: %s <Server IP> <Server Port> <File Name> <Chunk Size> <Window Si`Oze>
./sender 127.0.0.1 9999 input.txt 256 6

You will be able to watch the output in the terminal tabs in real time.
When the tr`Oansmition is finished the message will be displayed in the reciever tab
and the receiver will wait for more senders.
