Packet description:
    type : describes the type of packet i.e segment or ack packet
    length : length of data
    isLastPacket : whether it is terminal packet or not
    payload : actual data
    sequence No : to ensure that packets are in order

File read:
    Reading whole file in one go

File write:
    writting one packet at a time in file

Features : 
    - random time delay in sending ack at receiver side using delay function
    - receiver buffer stores whole file then write it to output.txt in one go
    - sender sends ws packets at a time and maintains base (next expected ack)
    - asynchronous calls used for timeout timer using alarm system call

To run:
Use any Unix system. Open two terminal tabs.

In the first tab, compile both the sender and receiver code with commands:
make makefile sender
make makefile receiver

In the first tab, start the reciever:
Usage:  %s <UDP SERVER PORT> <CHUNK SIZE>
./receiver 9999 256 .1  (set the lose rate to what you want it)

In the second tab, run the Sender:
Usage: %s <Server IP> <Server Port> <File Name> <Chunk Size> <Window Size>
./sender 127.0.0.1 9999 input.txt 256 6

You will be able to watch the output in the terminal tabs in real time.
When the transmition is finished the message will be displayed in the reciever tab
and the receiver will wait for more senders.
